# Rails Engine

Welcome to my ```Rails Engine``` Project!

This was created as part of a project at Turing and provides 11 fully functioning and tested API endpoint to a mock ecommerce database.

### Some of the main technical components
1.  RoR
2.  API Creation
3.  API Testing
4.  Postman
5.  ActiveRecord/SQL
6.  Serializers
7.  JSON


This project is meant to run on localhost and can be tested by running ```bundle exec rspec``` to review the passing tests for this API.
